README.txt

This README serves to explain how to run the program.  Ensure that the DFA.txt and Query.txt files
are in the src folder.  In command line, type "javac *.java" to compile all the java files.  In
command line, type "java Main" to run the class to generate your desired text files.
These files will be added to the src folder.

The data structures are explained in the comments in each class.
